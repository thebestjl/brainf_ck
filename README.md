The interpreter accepts up to two arguments, but a minimum of one:
A filename with the .bf extension is always required.
A choice of mode is also accepted, which will switch between implementations:
  Mode '1': Standard implementation that uses pointers.
  Mode '2': Slightly simpler implementation (though, effectively the same) that uses an index variable and array variable.

Originally written as a class assignment, I recently found an incomplete version of the interpreter and fixed it up, adding in file reading and filetype handling.
